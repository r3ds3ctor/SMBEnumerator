# SMBEnumerator
SMBEnumerator is a powerful SMB (Server Message Block) enumeration tool designed to gather detailed information about Windows systems, including users, shared resources, domain groups, and operating system details. It leverages tools like smbclient and rpcclient to perform null-session enumeration, RID cycling, and more. Whether you're conducting security assessments or network audits, SMBEnumerator provides a streamlined way to extract critical information from SMB servers.

Key Features:

Enumerate domain users and shared resources.

Perform RID cycling to discover hidden users and groups.

Gather operating system and domain information.

Export results in JSON format for further analysis.

Supports both authenticated and null-session enumeration.

## Features

- Enumerate domain users.
- Enumerate shared resources.
- Enumerate domain groups and their members.
- Enumerate operating system information.
- Perform RID cycling to discover users and groups.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `smbclient` and `rpcclient` installed on the system.

-p, -P: Specify the password.

-shares: Enumerate shared resources.

-users: Enumerate users.

-q, -quick: Perform a quick user enumeration.

-r, -rid: Perform only RID cycling.

-range: Specify a custom RID cycling range (default: 500-550).

-T: Specify the maximum number of threads for RID cycling (default: 15).
